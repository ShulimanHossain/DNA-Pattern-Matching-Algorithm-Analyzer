🧬 DNA Pattern Matching Algorithm Analyzer
📖 Overview

The DNA Pattern Matching Algorithm Analyzer is a C++ program designed to compare and analyze different string-matching algorithms on DNA sequences.
It allows users to test how efficiently various algorithms—Naive, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Boyer-Moore—can detect a specific DNA pattern within a DNA sequence.

This project helps visualize pattern occurrence positions, algorithmic performance, and execution time comparison, making it useful for both bioinformatics and algorithm analysis studies.
