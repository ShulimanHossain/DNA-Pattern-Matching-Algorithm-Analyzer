#  DNA Pattern Matching Algorithm Analyzer


The DNA Pattern Matching Algorithm Analyzer is a C++ program designed to compare and analyze different string-matching algorithms on DNA sequences. It allows users to test how efficiently various algorithms—Naive, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Boyer-Moore—can detect a specific DNA pattern within a DNA sequence. This project helps visualize pattern occurrence positions, algorithmic performance, and execution time comparison, making it useful for both bioinformatics and algorithm analysis studies.

## Features

 - Validate DNA input sequences (only A, T, G, C are allowed)

 - Run individual algorithms: Naive, KMP, or Boyer-Moore

 - Compare two or all algorithms based on execution time

 - Measure average execution time using multiple iterations

 - Display detailed results including:

 - Match positions (start and end indices)

 - Number of occurrences

 - Time complexity (theoretical and measured)

 - Theoretical complexity display for each algorithm

## Requirements
  - **Compiler**: C++
